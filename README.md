mcAuth
======
This is one of my first python projects, any improvements for my skills are welcome!
What this little program does is request the login strings from mojang and save them to the file "~/.minecraft/launcher_profiles.json"
and it's made for a Minecraft gamestation so that the users don't need to know the login credentials. https://imgur.com/a/sNP8Q
Required libraries:
- simplejson
- requests
